This driver implements the ESC/P standard for communicating with
9-pin head impact mactrix printers via an emulated parallel port.
It has been tested against a MT81 Tally printer using a raspberrypi
host.
Parallel port emulation hardware was provided by the broadcomm gpio
module and an external 8-bit gpio expander (PCF8574A) connected via
the smbus (I2c module).
